## [0.10.0] — 2026-05-05

First public release of the **egisai** Python SDK from the open-source
repository at [`EgisLabs/egisai-sdk`](https://github.com/EgisLabs/egisai-sdk).

The SDK provides runtime governance for AI agents: import-time patching of
OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and common HTTP clients so governed calls
are evaluated against policies from the EgisAI platform, with deterministic
local checks (PII, regex, size, model allow-list) and audit telemetry that
mirror operator-defined rules.
